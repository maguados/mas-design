                        <p>I’m a UX/UI Designer with a background in college level teaching, linguistics, and immigration law. Finding myself in User Experience Design has been a lifelong journey with pit stops equipping me to become an empathetic, thoughtful, and solution-oriented designer</p>

                        <p>As a child in my native <b>Mexico City</b> I was a <b>visual arts enthusiast</b>. I spent afternoons drawing and painting, and I attended art exhibitions during the weekends. My friends and family assumed I would become a designer. When I pursued a <b>career in linguistics</b>, they were in shock.</p>
                        <p>Despite their expectations, I wanted to <b> understand people and their needs</b>. Doing so is important to <b>finding solutions and bettering lives</b>, which ultimately is my career goal. That goal led me to complete my graduate education at <b>UC Davis</b>. While working as Spanish instructor, I focused my graduate research on linguistic minority groups and the difficulties their speakers faced when navigating educational and medical contexts. After UC Davis, I wanted to be involved in a less theoretical and more hands-on role.</p>
                        <p>I went on to manage the paralegal staff at an <b>immigration law</b> firm based in Nashville, TN. This work represented an opportunity to find immediate life-impacting solutions for our clients. Aside from my paralegal duties, <b>I designed the firm’s website, promotional material, and social media content</b>. I even did radio commercials! The creative aspects of this role re-ignited my childhood passion for visual art, and set me on my course to become a designer.</p>
                        <p>User Experience design combines research skills, an empathetic mindset, and design in order to help organizations better understand their users and together craft meaningful experiences for them. When I learned this was a job, I was immediately hooked. I began taking online courses and creating my own projects. When I decided to truly take the plunge, I enrolled in <b>Thinkful’s UX Design Program</b> which I am expected to complete in the upcoming months. <b>I am excited to enter this industry and put my skills into work!</b></p>
                        <p><b>I would love to share my work with you and see if we can create something together.</b></p>
