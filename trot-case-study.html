Both of these tools have strengths like real-time collaboration capabilities, and they are highly customizable. Yet, these tools are not geared towards trip planning.</p>

While this company turns around the traveling industry, its trip planning feature is not a main component of their platform. Surveyed participants who have used this product mistrusted its user-based content.</p>

                            <p>Before beginning to design a MVP, I identified some user stories for new and returning users and I ranked them based on their priority. Then, I turned the highest priority stories into user flows.</p>

                        <h3>Finding the brand’s identity</h3>
                        <h4>One step at a time</h4>
                        <p>While developing the branding  it occured to me that when people plan for a trip they have to do it “step by step”. The first step is usually plan a destination, the second is to choose the dates of the trip, then to book a hotel, and so on. But also, when users arrive at their destination, they also take a lot of steps - literally. They take steps to enjoy the trip by walking to museums, strolling in parks, hiking, etc. I got fixated with that idea, and I thought that I wanted to create a platform that made both kinds of steps easy, simple, and enjoyable. With that in mind, I thought about the word “trot”.</p>
                        <p>My background in lingüistics (and the nerd in me) took me to do some research about the etymology of this word, and realized that it is a cognate in several languages like Spanish, Italian, French, and some Germanic variants. In most of them, it had a similar meaning: a speedy walk and/or wandering. Hence, you have words like “globe-trotter” in English.</p>
                        <p>I liked the semantic charge that this word carried, and phonologically I really liked that it is one syllable with an open vowel and plosive sounds at the beginning and at the end. In other words, it is fun-sounding and it is charged with energy when you say it!</p>

I then thought about the colors one sees when  looking out of an aiplane window during a flight, and decided to use that as my inspiration to come up with the color palette.</p>

                        <p>After I settled with a new iteration for some problematic screens and flows, I created a High Fidelity prototype which considered all the feedback obtained from users up to this point. Then, I tested it once more.</p>
                        <p>Through this new round of testing I was able to identify parts of my design that needed improvement and that I had not identified before. Then, I went back to the design board to make the appropriate changes and finally come up with a final MVP.</p>

                        <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
                        <h4>Be aware of "scope creep"</h4>
                        <p>Trot was a project I was very passionate about. It was created out of a need I had in real life. I was very excited about it and at the begining of the proyect, I had many ideas about features that I wanted to include in the tool. While the purpose of Trot is to have a highly customizable trip planning experience, I had to learn to focus in the "must haves" and keep the "nice-to-haves" for later iterations of the project.</p>
                        <h4>Test, test, test, and test again!</h4>
                        <p>User testing was the most valuable resource throughout the project. Their oppinion was invaluable in order to decide what features to concentrate on during the first iteration of the MVP.</p>
                        <p>During testing, it was great to see what parts of the design worked well, but it was even better to see what parts had problems. It aws only through the eyes of testers that I was able to see design flaws that I would not have noticed other wise.</p>
